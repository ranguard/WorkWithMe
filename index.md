# Mid Level Full Stack JavaScript Developer (Remote)

## About us

I'm looking for someone to work with. I recently joined a startup that I have known for several years. I want to take the startup from a great service, held together with google apps, manual data entry and sweat. To a company with the power to scale and the ability to offer an even better customer experience.

[Air Agents](https://www.theairagents.com/)  are one of the worlds fastest growing management companies for hosts on Airbnb. As the first ever official Host management partner of Airbnb, they focus on providing exceptional hospitality to their guests. Thus leading to amazing reviews, better occupancy and in turn the best possible revenue for their clients. 

They also have no less than 2 Dragons Den investors and have big plans to scale quickly in this fast growing sector.

As green field development we'll be using all the buzz words: _"Leveraging Service full Serverless, Event driven architecture with observability, based on AWS, GraphQL, Node.js and Vue.js"_. Read [my write up on this](https://medium.com/@leolapworth/the-startup-stack-that-wasnt-1581df97b2eb) for more insight into what that actually means! We will build the core of the system, but outsource various parts to ensure the best use of our time.

## About you

You don't have to be a coding guru, but you should be...

- Able to research and pick up technology (we will be using a _lot_ of different amazon services for example)
- Passionate about writing clean and well-thought out code
- A good communicator and able to clearly articulate technical problems
- You work well independently and are driven to find solutions
- Able to ask for help when needed
- Motivated to continually learning
  
## Requirements

- 3+ years JavaScript / Node.js experience
- Experience with a front end framework (Vue/React/Angular etc)
- NoSQL (some experience) - eg. Elasticsearch / DynamoDB
- SQL (fundamentals at least) - eg. MySQL / PostgreSQL
- Git
- Automated Testing experience
  
### Nice to have

If you don't have these I can teach you most of it and we'll Google the rest together.

- Vue.js (or React experience, as lots of similarities)
- GraphQL
- AWS serverless: lambda / api gateway / DynamoDB etc etc 
- TypeScript
- Some level of design skills
